# Ese Pedidos

DISCLAIMER: This project was meant to go live in my city, given that there's nothing like it there. Due to personal issues I was unable to do this so I decided to upload it to GitHub.

# How does it work?

This project is meant to facilitate ordering food from restaurants. Instead of calling a number for ordering food there is an app that handles all that.

There are 2 apps, one is for the clients and the other one is for the restaurants.

On the clients app, you will be presented with a choice of restaurants. After picking one, you can then select what food you will order and the delivery destination.

Once you've done this, you have to wait until the restaurant processes (i.e, confirms) your order.
